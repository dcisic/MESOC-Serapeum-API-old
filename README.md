MESOC

        MESOC is a Research and Innovation Action designed to propose, test and validate an innovative and original approach to measuring the societal value and impacts of culture and cultural policies and practices, related to three crossover themes of the new European Agenda for Culture :
         1) Health and Wellbeing,
         2)Urban and Territorial Renovation and
        3)People’s Engagement and Participation.
The global aim is to respond to the challenge posed by the H2020 Call ”To develop new perspectives and improved methodologies for capturing the wider societal value of culture, including but also beyond its economic impact”


MESOC SERAPEUM

        Project idea is to enable MESOC consortium members and other cultural stakeholders to become acquainted with the achievements of artificial intelligence and gain insight into the possibilities of AI. It is work in progress and will be updated regularly.AI tools are especially used to identify transaction variables that define contextualisation of research findings.
